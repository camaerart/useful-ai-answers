QUESTION 1: How can I solve this error ? тип Error: PrismaClient is unable to run in Vercel Edge Functions. As an alternative, try Accelerate: https://pris.ly/d/accelerate. 

Based on the information provided in the extracts, it appears that you are encountering an issue with Prisma Client not being able to run in the Vercel Edge Functions environment. There are a couple of workarounds suggested for similar issues that you might find helpful:

1. **Use Prisma DataProxy**: You can use Prisma DataProxy to communicate with your database. This involves generating your Prisma Client with the `--data-proxy` flag and then importing `@prisma/client/edge` into your application. This generates an edge-optimized Prisma Client that communicates with the DataProxy via HTTP. Here's how you can generate the client:

   ```sh
   prisma generate --data-proxy
   ```

   And then in your application code, you would import the edge client:

   ```js
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge';
   ```

2. **Avoid using the edge runtime**: If you are not specifically required to use the Vercel Edge Runtime, you can configure your project to deploy its API functions as serverless functions, which Prisma already supports. You can do this by setting the runtime configuration for your routes to "nodejs":

   ```js
   export const runtime = "nodejs";
   ```

If neither of these workarounds is suitable for your use case, or if you encounter further issues, it is recommended to follow the progress on the open GitHub issue where Prisma's team is working on improving support for the Vercel Edge Runtime and Edge Functions. You can also report your specific issue there for more tailored support.
